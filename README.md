# 4A4 Aircraft stability and control coursework

Aircraft dynamic of Saab340B is modeled in MATLAB by analysing the static and dynamic modes of the aircraft calculated using the raw fligth data.

4A4a - calculating centre of mass, neutral point and maneuver point.
4A4b - calculating poles of aircraft dynamics from control-free response to step and impulse response.
4A4c - calculating zeros of aircraft dynamics using FFT.
4A4d - control system is designed to supress modes and enforce C* reponse
